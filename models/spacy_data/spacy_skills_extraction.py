# JSONL structure consists of key-value pairs. The value for patterns here is a list of spaCy token-attribute dictionaries.
# Attributes used: TEXT - The exact verbatim text of a token, LOWER - The lowercase form of the token text
# For example, [{"LOWER":"3d"},{"LOWER":"reconstruction"}] would match 3D Reconstruction, 3d Reconstruction, or 3d reconstruction.
# There are 2,129 skill patterns in this jsonl file.

* Understand the end to end flow of the solution, doing research and development for classification models, predictive analysis and mining of the information present in text data. Worked on analyzing the outputs and precision monitoring for the entire tool.
* TAR assists in predictive coding, topic modelling from the evidence by following EY standards. Developed the classifier models in order to identify "red flags" and fraud-related issues.

Tools & Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, tfidf, word2vec, doc2vec, cosine similarity, NaÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes, LDA, NMF for topic modelling, Vader and text blob for sentiment analysis. Matplot lib, Tableau dashboard for reporting.

MULTIPLE DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTIC PROJECTS (USA CLIENTS)
TEXT ANALYTICS - MOTOR VEHICLE CUSTOMER REVIEW DATA * Received customer feedback survey data for past one year. Performed sentiment (Positive, Negative & Neutral) and time series analysis on customer comments across all 4 categories.
* Created heat map of terms by survey category based on frequency of words * Extracted Positive and Negative words across all the Survey categories and plotted Word cloud.
* Created customized tableau dashboards for effective reporting and visualizations.
CHATBOT * Developed a user friendly chatbot for one of our Products which handle simple questions about hours of operation, reservation options and so on.
* This chat bot serves entire product related questions. Giving overview of tool via QA platform and also give recommendation responses so that user question to build chain of relevant answer.
* This too has intelligence to build the pipeline of questions as per user requirement and asks the relevant /recommended questions.

INFORMATION GOVERNANCE
Organizations to make informed decisions about all of the information they store. The integrated Information Governance portfolio synthesizes intelligence across unstructured data sources and facilitates action to ensure organizations are best positioned to counter information risk.
* Scan data from multiple sources of formats and parse different file formats, extract Meta data information, push results for indexing elastic search and created customized, interactive dashboards using kibana.
* Preforming ROT Analysis on the data which give information of data which helps identify content that is either Redundant, Outdated, or Trivial.
* Preforming full-text search analysis on elastic search with predefined methods which can tag as (PII) personally identifiable information (social security numbers, addresses, names, etc.) which frequently targeted during cyber-attacks.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Flask, Elastic Search, Kibana

FRAUD ANALYTIC PLATFORM
